## Introduction

Follow this guide to get set up with LemonSqueezy.

## Create LemonSqueezy Account

1. First, [create a LemonSqueezy account](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/register) if you don't have one already. Follow the onboarding instructions to set up your LemonSqueezy account.

## Getting the API Key

2. Create a new API key in the [API keys page](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/api).
3. In the `.env` file of your project, add the key to the `LEMON_SQUEEZY_API_KEY` variable.

## Getting the Store ID

4. Get the Store ID in the [Stores Settings page](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/stores). Copy the number without the # sign, and paste it into `LEMON_SQUEEZY_STORE_ID` in `.env`.

For example, if your store ID is #11111, it should look like:

```env filename=".env" copy
LEMON_SQUEEZY_STORE_ID=11111
```

## Creating Products and Variants

5. For your user to choose between different subscription plans, you will need to create a *Product* first on the [Products page](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/products). Click "**+ New Product**" and go down to the **Variants** section. Here, you will add a variant for each subscription plan you want to offer. For example, if you have a $9/month plan and a $29/month plan, you will be adding 2 variants, one for each plan.

6. After you filled out the details and saved the product, click on the Product, go to the **Variants** section, copy the IDs for each variant, and paste them into the `LEMON_SQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID_1` and `LEMON_SQUEEZY_VARIANT_ID_2` variables in the `.env` file of your project.

## Changing the Project Files

7. In your RyzeKit project, go to `/src/lib/payments/handler.ts` and make the following change at the top of the file (in the imports section):
    ```typescript filename="/src/lib/payments/handler.ts" copy
    // import * as payments from "@/lib/payments/stripe";
    import * as payments from "@/lib/payments/lemonsqueezy";
    ```
    Basically, comment out the payments/stripe line and uncomment the payments/lemonsqueezy line.

## Creating a Webhook

8. To update the current subscription status of a user and other information in your database, you will need to set up a LemonSqueezy webhook. First, go to the [Webhooks page](https://app.lemonsqueezy.com/settings/webhooks) and click "**+ Add endpoint**".
9. Next, fill in the details to create the webhook endpoint.
    * For **Callback URL**, be sure to add `/api/webhook` to the end of your website name.
        * for example: www.myapp.com/api/webhook
        * If you are using localhost, you can use a tunneling tool like [Tunnelmole](https://github.com/robbie-cahill/tunnelmole-client) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet. Just be sure to add `/api/webhook` at the end of your tunneled URL.
    * For **Signing secret**, input a random string. Then, copy and paste this string into `LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE` in the `.env` file of your project.
        * You can generate a random string by running the following command in your terminal.
        ```bash copy
        openssl rand -base64 32
        ```
    * For **What updates should we send?**, choose the following events:
        * `order_created`
        * `subscription_cancelled`
10. If you are in test mode, you can try purchasing the product or subscription plan with a [test payment method](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/guides/developer-guide/testing-going-live). In the webhook page, you will then be able to see whether the webhook was configured successfully.
