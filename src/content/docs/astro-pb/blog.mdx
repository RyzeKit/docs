## Introduction

This starter kit integrates [Astro Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) for blogging. Content Collections lets you write content in MDX and/or Markdown and keep blog posts under version control.

## Creating a new blog post

To create a new blog post, create a new `.mdx` or `.md` file in the `/src/content/blog/` folder. The file name will be the url slug of the post. For example, if you want the url to be http://localhost:4321/help/my-guide, then the file should have the following path: `/src/content/blog/my-post.mdx`.

The file should start with the frontmatter block, which contains metadata about the post. The frontmatter block should be surrounded by three dashes (---). Afterwards will be the content of the blog post.

```mdx filename="my-post.mdx" {} copy
