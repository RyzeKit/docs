## Introduction

The Astro + Pocketbase starter kit is powered by [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/), a lightweight and self-hostable backend that uses SQLite as its database and is suited for small to mid-sized apps.

## Pocketbase Setup

1. Download & install a new Pocketbase instance by following the [official documentation](https://pocketbase.io/docs/).
2. Create an admin account and login to your Pocketbase instance.
3. In the `.env` file of your Astro project, update the `POCKETBASE_URL=` with the Pocketbase URL of your instance.
    ```env filename=".env" {2} copy
    # Pocketbase
    POCKETBASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090
    ...
    ```

## Email Setup

4. Go to the [**Mail settings** page](http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/#/settings/mail) in your Pocketbase instance and turn on **Use SMTP mail server**.
5. Update the settings with your SMTP credentials.
6. Click **Send test email** to send a test email to yourself and see if the mail settings are set up correctly.
7. Next, in the `pocketbase` folder of your Astro project, copy the `pb_hooks` folder and paste it into your Pocketbase project folder.

## Try it out

8. Now in the home page of your Astro app, you can test authentication by clicking the **Sign Up** button and creating a new account. Once you have created an account, the app should redirect you to the dashboard page. Signing out should redirect you to the home page.
