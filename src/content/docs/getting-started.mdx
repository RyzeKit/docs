### Welcome to RyzeKit ðŸš€

Get your app up and running by following the steps below.

## Prerequisites

Before you can get started, you will need to have the following installed on your machine.

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- Git
- pnpm
- A code editor (VSCode, VSCodium, WebStorm, etc.)

## Set up a new database

> This starter kit uses [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) as the database ORM. It is currently configured to use PostgreSQL, but you can manually modify it to use MySQL or SQLite instead. For PostgreSQL, we recommend [Neon](https://neon.tech/) and [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/templates/B20CX0).

Create a new PostgreSQL database and have the connection string ready. The connection string should look something like this:

```env copy
postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

## Initialize a new project

Next, go to your terminal. Then, clone the Github repository.

```sh copy
git clone https://github.com/RyzeKit/astro-starterkit.git
```

Navigate into the project directory.

```sh copy
cd astro-starterkit
```

Install the dependencies.

```sh copy
pnpm install
```

Now, re-initialize Git for your project.

```sh copy
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the `.env.example` file.

```sh copy
cp .env.example .env
```

## Migrate the database

Open the `.env` file in your code editor and update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with your database connection string from above.

```env filename=".env" {2} copy
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
...
```

Migrate your database.

```sh copy
pnpm drizzle-kit push
```

Now if you check your database, you should see the `user`, `session`, and `subscription` tables.

## Start the development server

Run the following command in your terminal to start the development server.

```sh copy
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:4321 in your browser to see your app.

ðŸš€ Congratulations, your app is now up and running! Proceed to the next page to continue with setup.

<Aside>
You might come across an <u>Invalid URL</u> error. This is due to other environment variables not being set yet, so don't worry about this. We will set the other environment variables in the next page.
