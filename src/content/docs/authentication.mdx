## Introduction

This starter kit mainly uses [Logto](https://logto.io/) for authentication, with [Lucia Auth](https://lucia-auth.com/) as the middleman to connect Logto with Astro. Logto is a feature-rich 3rd-party authentication provider that supports multiple authentication methods, including email, password, OTP, and social providers.

## Logto Authentication Setup

1. Create a [Logto](https://auth.logto.io/register) account if you don't have one already.
2. Create a tenant (any tenant name and data region should be fine).

3. Create your sign-in experience.
    * For **Identifier**, choose **Email address**, because **Username** is not included in this starter kit at this time.
    * For **Password**, you can choose any combination of **Password** and/or **Verification code**.
    * For **Social sign-in**, choose the social provider of your choice, if any.
    * For our example, we will be choosing **Email address**, **Password**, **Verification code**, and **Github**.

4. In the Logto console, go to **Applications**. Then, scroll down to the bottom and click **View all ->**. Then at the bottom right, click **Create app without framework**. Select **Traditional Web** and fill in the application details and click **Create application**.

5. Under **Redirect URIs**, enter `http://localhost:4321/callback`. Under **Post sign-out redirect URIs**, enter `http://localhost:4321` (no trailing backslash!). Then click **Save changes**.
    * *Note:* Having a trailing backslash at the end (e.g. `http://localhost:4321/`) will cause sign-outs to fail.

6. Scroll down to the **Endpoints & Credentials** section. Update the `.env` file of your project with your Logto credentials (see image below for the environment variables).
    <Image src='/src/assets/Logto-Config.png' alt='Logto-Config' width='750' height='450'></Image>
    * Your `.env` file should now look something like this:
    ```env filename=".env" {3-5} copy
    ...
    # Logto Auth Config
    LOGTO_ENDPOINT=https://5n0udg.logto.app/
    LOGTO_APP_ID=isr5scfm8yzoy9leviq0y
    LOGTO_APP_SECRET=<app-secret>
    ...
    ```
7. Now in the home page of your app, you can test authentication by clicking the **Sign Up** button and creating a new account. Once you have created an account, the app should redirect you to the dashboard page. Signing out should redirect you to the home page.

## Logto Management API Setup

The Logto Management API is used by the starter kit to interact with Logto via API. Follow the steps below to get it set up.

1. In the Logto console, go to **Applications** and click the **+ Create application** button in the top right.

2. Scroll down to **Machine-to-machine** and click **Start building**. Then fill in the application details and click **Create application**.

3. Check the box next to **Logto Management API access role** and click the **Assign roles** button.

4. Scroll down to **2. Basics about access token request**. Update the `.env` file with app ID and app secret (see image below for the corresponding environment variables). Afterwards, click **Finish and done**.
    <Image src='/src/assets/M2M-Config.png' alt='M2M-Config' width='750' height='450'></Image>
    * Your `.env` file should now look something like this:
    ```env filename=".env" {3-4} copy
    ...
    # Logto API Config
    LOGTO_M2M_APP_ID=su9l5pz27kgyp9quiavxy
    LOGTO_M2M_APP_SECRET=<app_secret>
    ...
    ```
5. You can now test the Logto API by logging in to your starter kit app, going to the **Account** page, and changing the user's email address or password. Behind the scenes, your app should be able to successfully connect to the Logto Management API to make the changes.
