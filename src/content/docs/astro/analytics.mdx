## Introduction

This starter kit uses [Umami](https://umami.is/) for analytics. It is a privacy-friendly and easy-to-use analytics platform that lets you track your website performance without cookie banners. It is GDPR and CCPA compliant by default.

## Setup

1. Create an Umami account if you don't have one already.
2. Go through the process of adding a website.
3. In the Umami console, in the settings page of your website, you should see a **Website ID** field. Copy & paste its value into `UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` in the environment variables for your deployed app.

ðŸš€ Congratulations, you've successfully set up analytics!
