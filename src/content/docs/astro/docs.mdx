## Introduction

This starter kit integrates [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) for documentation. Starlight is a documentation framework built on top of Astro by the Astro team, allowing for first-class support. In this starter kit, the docs portion is labeled as **Help Center**.

## Creating a documentation page

To create a new docs page, create a new `.mdx` or `.md` file in the `/src/content/docs/help/` folder. The file name will be the url slug of the post. For example, if you want the url to be http://localhost:4321/help/my-post, then the file should have the following path: `/src/content/docs/help/my-guide.mdx`.

The file should start with the frontmatter block, which contains metadata about the post. The frontmatter block should be surrounded by three dashes (---). Afterwards will be the content of the docs page.

```mdx filename="my-post.mdx" {} copy
---
title: My Guide
description: My help guide in the help center.
---

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with the platform.
```

Then, in the `astro.config.mjs` file, insert an item for the new docs page in the `starlight` integration's `sidebar` property. An example is shown below:

```js filename="astro.config.mjs" {13-16} copy
...
    starlight({
      title: "Company",
      customCss: [
        // Modify with this file with custom styling for your docs
        "./src/styles/docs.css",
      ],
      sidebar: [
        {
          label: "Home",
          slug: "help",
        },
        {
          label: "My Guide",
          slug: "help/my-guide",
        },
        {
          label: "Guides",
...
```

## Modifying the styling

You can modify the styling of your documentation by editing the `/src/styles/docs.css` file. For more information about how to style your documentation pages, consult the [official documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/).

ðŸš€ Congratulations on creating your first documentation page!
