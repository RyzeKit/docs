## Introduction

This starter kit integrates with [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) for sending emails. You can connect any email provider that supports SMTP with Nodemailer, such as [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/).

## Setup

1. In the `.env` file in your project, add your email provider credentials. It should look something like this:

```env filename=".env" {3-8} copy
...
# Email
EMAIL_FROM=contact@yourdomain.com
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_TLS=no
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USERNAME=<smtp-username>
EMAIL_PASSWORD=<smtp-password>
...
```

* *Note:* `EMAIL_TLS` should be either `no` or `yes`.

2. Restart your Astro server in your terminal to apply the changes.

3. To test your email configuration, go to http://localhost:4321/contact, fill in the form, and submit it. Then, check the inbox that you sent the email to and see if your message is there.
